Your Optimized Supabase SQL Workflow in Cursor
üîÅ Step-by-Step Process
1. Track & Document Schema in sql_commands.md
Maintain full details of:

Tables (structure, constraints, relationships)

Functions & Triggers

Indexes

Policies

Format: Clean markdown with SQL blocks + explanations

Purpose: Acts as the single source of truth for schema evolution

2. Live Sync to Supabase
Every schema change (new table, function, update) must:

Be written as clean SQL

Be pushed to Supabase SQL Editor or via CLI/WSL

‚û° Push to Supabase
‚úÖ Update sql_commands.md with this command and a note

3. Always Reference sql_commands.md First
Before writing new commands:

Open sql_commands.md

See what already exists

Avoid conflicts or duplicates

Also helps when debugging frontend/backend sync issues

4. Optimize Schema Based on Workflow
Use proper indexes, constraints, and relationships

Add updated_at triggers

Enable row-level security (RLS) where needed


5. Keep the Workflow Clean & Synchronized
No changes go live unless:

They are committed to sql_commands.md

They are confirmed working in Supabase

Consistent naming, timestamps, and audit trails
