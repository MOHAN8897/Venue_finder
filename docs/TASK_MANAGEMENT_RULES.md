# Task Management Rules for Venue Finder Project

This document establishes systematic rules for task analysis, implementation, and tracking to ensure consistent, organized development workflow.

---

## **📋 Task Management Workflow**

### **Rule 1: Pre-Implementation Analysis**
**BEFORE** starting any task implementation:

1. **📖 Read and Analyze Task Requirements**
   - Read the complete task description
   - Understand all subtasks and deliverables
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites
   - Note estimated time and priority level

2. **🔍 Codebase Analysis**
   - Search existing codebase for related functionality
   - Identify files that need to be created or modified
   - Check for existing utilities or components that can be reused
   - Analyze current implementation to understand integration points

3. **📝 Plan Implementation Approach**
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Identify potential challenges or edge cases
   - Plan error handling and validation
   - Consider performance and user experience implications

4. **✅ Validate Task Understanding**
   - Confirm understanding of requirements
   - Identify any unclear or missing requirements
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed
   - Ensure alignment with project goals

### **Rule 2: Implementation Process**

1. **🎯 Start with Highest Priority Tasks**
   - Begin with Phase 1 tasks (Core Validation & Processing)
   - Follow the established task order within each phase
   - Complete all subtasks before marking task as complete

2. **📁 File Management**
   - Create new files as specified in task requirements
   - Update existing files with proper version control
   - Maintain consistent file naming and structure
   - Follow established code patterns and conventions

3. **🔧 Implementation Standards**
   - Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
   - Include proper TypeScript types and interfaces
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement proper validation and user feedback
   - Follow accessibility best practices

4. **🧪 Testing During Implementation**
   - Test each function/component as it's created
   - Verify integration with existing code
   - Check for edge cases and error scenarios
   - Ensure responsive design and mobile compatibility

---

### **Rule 3: Post-Implementation Updates**

**AFTER** completing any task:

1. **📊 Update Task Status**
   - Mark completed subtasks with ✅
   - Update task status from "⏳ Pending" to "✅ Completed"
   - Add completion timestamp
   - Note any deviations from original plan

2. **📝 Document Changes**
   - Update CODE_CHANGE_LOG.md with detailed implementation notes
   - Document any challenges encountered and solutions
   - Note performance improvements or optimizations
   - Record user experience enhancements

3. **🔍 Verify Deliverables**
   - Confirm all deliverables are completed
   - Test functionality thoroughly
   - Verify integration with existing systems
   - Check for any breaking changes

4. **📋 Plan Next Steps**
   - Identify the next task to implement
   - Update task priorities if needed
   - Note any dependencies that are now resolved
   - Plan for any follow-up tasks or refinements

## **📋 Task Tracking Format**

### **Task Status Indicators:**
- **⏳ Pending**: Task not yet started
- **🔄 In Progress**: Task currently being worked on
- **✅ Completed**: Task finished successfully
- **⚠️ Blocked**: Task blocked by dependencies or issues
- **🔄 Needs Review**: Task completed but needs review/testing

### **Task Update Template:**
```markdown
### **Task X.X: [Task Name]**
**File**: `path/to/file` (NEW/UPDATE)
**Estimated Time**: XX minutes
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

#### **Subtasks:**
- [x] **X.X.1** [Subtask description] ✅
- [x] **X.X.2** [Subtask description] ✅
- [x] **X.X.3** [Subtask description] ✅

#### **Implementation Notes:**
- [Brief description of what was implemented]
- [Any challenges encountered and solutions]
- [Performance optimizations or improvements]
- [Integration details]

#### **Next Task:**
- **Next**: Task X.X+1: [Next Task Name]
- **Dependencies**: [Any dependencies that need to be resolved]
- **Priority**: [Updated priority if changed]
```

## **🎯 Current Project: Image Upload Implementation**

### **Project Status:**
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Core Image Validation & Processing
- **Current Task**: Task 1.1 - Create Image Validation Utilities
- **Overall Progress**: 0% (0/12 tasks completed)
- **Estimated Remaining Time**: 2-3 hours

### **Task Priority Order:**
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Phase 1 (Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Phase 2 (Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4)
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Phase 3 (Tasks 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4)
4. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Phase 4 (Tasks 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)

### **Dependencies:**
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 completion
- Phase 4 can run parallel with Phase 3
