- [ ] Super Admin panel: Implement actual approve/reject actions (currently UI only)
- [ ] Add audit logging for all status changes
- [ ] Add notifications for status changes (user/admin)
- [ ] More granular error handling for failed submissions/updates

## [2024-08-02] Venue Approval System - Gap Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Gap Analysis
- SuperAdminDashboard UI does not currently implement approve/reject actions for venues.
- No frontend calls to backend functions (approve_venue, reject_venue) for status changes.
- Audit logging (venue_approval_logs) is not triggered from frontend.
- No notification logic for venue status changes (user not notified on approval/rejection).

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Add approve/reject buttons and logic in SuperAdminDashboard for each pending venue.
- [ ] Call Supabase RPCs (approve_venue, reject_venue) on admin action.
- [ ] Log all actions to venue_approval_logs table.
- [ ] Trigger notification/email to user on status change.
- [ ] Update UI in user dashboard/profile to reflect real-time status.
- [ ] Document all changes in related markdown files.
