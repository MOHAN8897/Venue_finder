## [2024-08-02] Venue Submission & Approval Flow - Test Log

### Test Steps & Results

#### 1. List Your Venue (Frontend)
- [x] All form fields present and validated step-by-step
- [x] Media upload (images/videos) works and previews shown
- [x] Draft system works (save/recover by email)

### Issues/To-Do
- [ ] Super Admin panel: Implement actual approve/reject actions (currently UI only)
- [ ] Add audit logging for all status changes
- [ ] Add notifications for status changes (user/admin)
- [ ] More granular error handling for failed submissions/updates

## [2024-08-02] Venue Approval System - Gap Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Gap Analysis
- SuperAdminDashboard UI does not currently implement approve/reject actions for venues.
- No frontend calls to backend functions (approve_venue, reject_venue) for status changes.
- Audit logging (venue_approval_logs) is not triggered from frontend.
- No notification logic for venue status changes (user not notified on approval/rejection).

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Add approve/reject buttons and logic in SuperAdminDashboard for each pending venue.
- [ ] Call Supabase RPCs (approve_venue, reject_venue) on admin action.
- [ ] Log all actions to venue_approval_logs table.
- [ ] Trigger notification/email to user on status change.
- [ ] Update UI in user dashboard/profile to reflect real-time status.
- [ ] Document all changes in related markdown files.

## [2024-08-02] Venue Approval Workflow Implemented in SuperAdminDashboard

- Added logic to fetch pending, approved, and rejected venues from Supabase.
- Implemented Approve/Reject buttons for each pending venue.
- Integrated frontend with Supabase RPCs (approve_venue, reject_venue) for status changes.
- Updated UI in real time and added error/success handling.
- All actions are now logged and reflected in the admin panel.

## [2024-08-01] Minimal Venue Submission Flow Complete

- Minimal venue submission (name, type, user_id, status) is now live and tested.
- User cannot resubmit if a venue is pending; can resubmit if rejected; can submit more if approved.
- All events and SQL commands logged in CODE_CHANGE_LOG.md.
- Next step: Integrate Super Admin dashboard for venue approval/rejection and status management.

## [2024-08-01 19:30] Completed: Comprehensive Venue Approval, Owner Management, and Logging System Migration

- All required schema, triggers, RLS, and functions for venue approval, owner promotion, admin logging, and real-time support are now documented and ready for execution in Supabase.
- See `database/sql_commands.md` for the full migration and explanations.

## [2024-07-08] Super Admin Dashboard Replacement Completed

- Task: Remove old Super Admin dashboard and connect all paths, tabs, and pages to the new dashboard from GitHub.
