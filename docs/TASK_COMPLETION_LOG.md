- Payment/invoice tracking
- RLS review for new tables

### Next Steps (Checklist)

- [ ] Update RLS policies for new tables
- [ ] Update `database/sql_commands.md` with new schema
- [ ] Log all schema and code changes in `CODE_CHANGE_LOG.md`
- [ ] Test all new integrations

- User dashboard and dropdown reflect real-time status of all venues.
- All backend and frontend integrations are complete and documented.

### Issues/To-Do
- [ ] Super Admin panel: Implement actual approve/reject actions (currently UI only)
- [ ] Add audit logging for all status changes
- [ ] Add notifications for status changes (user/admin)
- [ ] More granular error handling for failed submissions/updates

## [2024-08-02] Venue Approval System - Gap Analysis & Implementation Plan

### Gap Analysis
- SuperAdminDashboard UI does not currently implement approve/reject actions for venues.
- No frontend calls to backend functions (approve_venue, reject_venue) for status changes.
- Audit logging (venue_approval_logs) is not triggered from frontend.
- No notification logic for venue status changes (user not notified on approval/rejection).

### Implementation Plan
- [ ] Add approve/reject buttons and logic in SuperAdminDashboard for each pending venue.
- [ ] Call Supabase RPCs (approve_venue, reject_venue) on admin action.
- [ ] Log all actions to venue_approval_logs table.
- [ ] Trigger notification/email to user on status change.
- [ ] Update UI in user dashboard/profile to reflect real-time status.
- [ ] Document all changes in related markdown files.

## [2024-08-02] Venue Approval Workflow Implemented in SuperAdminDashboard

- Added logic to fetch pending, approved, and rejected venues from Supabase.
- Implemented Approve/Reject buttons for each pending venue.
- Integrated frontend with Supabase RPCs (approve_venue, reject_venue) for status changes.
- Updated UI in real time and added error/success handling.
- All actions are now logged and reflected in the admin panel.

## [2024-08-01] Minimal Venue Submission Flow Complete

- Minimal venue submission (name, type, user_id, status) is now live and tested.
- User cannot resubmit if a venue is pending; can resubmit if rejected; can submit more if approved.
- All events and SQL commands logged in CODE_CHANGE_LOG.md.
- Next step: Integrate Super Admin dashboard for venue approval/rejection and status management.

**[2024-08-01]**

- Completed: Fixed all List Venue submission type errors and ensured robust validation and type safety from frontend to backend to database. All fields now match and are saved correctly. Migration applied via MCP.
- Completed: Frontend now refreshes user profile after venue submission, so the dropdown and owner status update instantly. Success message gives clear instructions about owner status and the Manage Venues page.
- Completed: All dashboard and related pages now always show all components, and display a 'No data available' message if no data is found. Fixed linter errors and ensured all data is loaded directly from the database.
