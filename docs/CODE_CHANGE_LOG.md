- Added type-safe error extraction in the catch block.
- This helps diagnose and fix issues where venue data is not saved to the database.

## [2024-08-01] Fixed venue submission type errors by:
- Updating the frontend to preprocess and coerce all numeric/enum fields before submission.
- Creating/updating the `submit_venue` function in Supabase to cast all fields to the correct types and handle empty strings/nulls robustly.
- All changes applied and tested via MCP.

## [2024-08-01] Frontend: Updated ListVenue page to call refreshUserProfile after successful venue submission, ensuring the dropdown and owner status update immediately.
- The success message now clearly tells the user they are a Venue Owner and can access the 'Manage Venues' page in their profile menu.

## [2024-08-01] Frontend: Updated OwnerDashboard, ManageVenues, and UserDashboard to always show all dashboard components, and display a clear 'No data available' message if no data is found. Removed early returns that hid the dashboard if data was missing. Fixed linter errors and ensured all data is loaded directly from the database.

## [2024-08-01] Backend: Verified and (re)applied all RLS policies, functions, triggers, and RPCs for dashboard and related pages to the Supabase database using the CLI (`supabase db push`). Ensured all required backend logic and security is in place for robust data access and storage.

## [2024-08-01] Fixed Venue Submission Flow and Eligibility Checks

- Added RLS policies to restrict insert/select to authenticated users and their own venues.
- Updated frontend (ListVenue.tsx) to:
  - Block resubmission if user has a pending venue.

- Integrated new Super Admin dashboard from external GitHub repo:
  - Copied all dashboard, layout, and UI components to `src/components/`
  - Added new dashboard pages to `src/pages/super-admin/`
  - Updated `src/App.tsx` to route all `/super-admin/*` paths to the new dashboard
  - Removed all references to old SuperAdmin components and routes
- Installed all new dependencies required by the dashboard (Radix UI, TanStack Query, etc.)
- Verified that all tabs, pages, and navigation for the new Super Admin dashboard are now active and correctly imported.
- This change fully replaces the old Super Admin system with the new, modern dashboard.

## [2024-06-08] Super Admin Panel Security & Routing Fixes
- Implemented `SuperAdminProtectedRoute` to restrict `/super-admin/*` access to signed-in super admins only.

- Ran `npm install` and `npm run build` to ensure all dependencies and imports are correct.
- Impact: Super admin panel is now secure, only accessible to super admins, and all navigation/pages load as expected.

## [2024-08-03TIST] Updated VenueListingForm to upload images to Supabase Storage before saving venue, using VenueSubmissionService.uploadFiles. Now, submitted venues will have their images stored in the 'venue-images' bucket and the database will store the public URLs.

## 2024-07-01  - Fix: Single-Tab Overlay Logic

**Changes Made:**
- Added cleanup for ACTIVE_TAB_KEY and ACTIVE_TAB_TIMESTAMP_KEY on tab close/unload in AuthContext.tsx.
- Implemented a timeout check for ACTIVE_TAB_TIMESTAMP_KEY (10s heartbeat) to prevent stale overlays when only one tab is open.
- Overlay now only appears if another tab is truly active for the same user session/role.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

**Technical Details:**
- On tab close/unload, if this tab is the active one, the active tab keys are removed from localStorage.
- On mount/focus/visibility, if the active tab timestamp is stale, the current tab claims active status.
- Prevents the "Switching Tabs..." overlay from showing when only one tab is open. 

## [2024-08-02] Frontend Role Naming and Logic Updates
- Updated all frontend role checks and assignments to use new role names: 'user', 'venue_owner', 'administrator', 'owner', 'super_admin'.
- Replaced all 'admin' checks with 'administrator'.
- Clarified logic and comments for 'owner' (website owner) and 'venue_owner' (venue owner).
- Fixed linter error in UserDashboard.tsx for useEffect return value.

## [2024-08-02] Role Naming and Venue Owner Promotion Updates
- Renamed 'admin' to 'administrator' in user_role enum for clarity.
- Updated approve_venue function to promote users to 'venue_owner' upon first venue approval (instead of 'owner' or 'admin').
- Clarified role naming conventions: 'user', 'venue_owner', 'administrator', 'owner', 'super_admin'.
- Updated documentation in sql_commands.md. 

## [2024-08-02] Frontend Update: Merge 'owner' and 'super_admin' Roles
- Removed all references to 'owner' in frontend role checks and replaced with 'super_admin'.
- Updated comments and UI logic to clarify 'super_admin' is now the website owner.
- Documented all changes in code change log. 

## [2024-08-01] Session Persistence and Expiry Fixes

- Ensured Supabase client is initialized with persistSession: true and autoRefreshToken: true for all user roles in src/lib/supabase.ts.
- Updated periodic session validity check in AuthContext to add a grace period retry and avoid unnecessary sign-outs or redirects if already on the sign-in page.
- Updated all signOut and forced logout logic in AuthContext, Header, DashboardHeader, and ResetPassword to avoid redundant redirects or sign-outs if already on the sign-in page.
- Added comments to supabase.ts for future maintainers.
- These changes resolve issues where user and super admin sessions were expiring prematurely or being logged out unnecessarily after inactivity.

Context: See conversation summary and project rules for details. All changes tested and verified. 

## [2024-08-02] All Approved/Rejected Venues Set to Cricket (Sports Venue)

- Updated all venues with approval_status 'approved' or 'rejected' to have venue_type = 'Sports Venue' (closest enum for cricket venues).
- SQL command executed:
  ```sql
  UPDATE public.venues
  SET venue_type = 'Sports Venue'
  WHERE approval_status IN ('approved', 'rejected');
  ```
- Context: This ensures all previously approved or rejected venues are now classified as cricket venues for the new dashboard integration.
- See also: database/sql_commands.md for full details.
- Timestamp: 2024-08-02 

## [2024-06-08] Updated Venue Dashboard Navigation and Redirects
- All navigation links previously pointing to `/cricket-dashboard` now point to `/manageyourpage-dashboard` for uniqueness and consistency.
- Added redirect routes in `App.tsx` so that `/cricket-dashboard` and `/cricket-dashboard/*` automatically forward to `/manageyourpage-dashboard`.
- This prevents 404 errors for users with old links and ensures all navigation is routed to the correct dashboard. 

## [2024-06-08] Removed Demo Data from Manage Venue Dashboard Settings
- All demo/default values in the settings fields (profile, venue, notifications, business) have been cleared.
- Initial values are now empty or false, with no prefilled fake data.
- This ensures a clean state for new users and prevents confusion. 

## [2024-06-08] Fixed Vertical Line Overlapping Footer
- Removed `border-r` class from the AppSidebar component in `src/components/cricket-dashboard/AppSidebar.tsx`.
- The right border on the sidebar was extending the full height and visually overlapping with the footer.
- This ensures the sidebar border does not extend beyond the dashboard content area. 

## [2024-06-08] Fixed Welcome Section Background and Text Colors
- Changed welcome section background from `bg-primary` to `bg-green-600` for explicit green background.
- Updated text colors to `text-white` and `text-white/90` to ensure proper white text contrast against the green background.

- Created canonical `subvenues` table for all sub-venue/space data.
- All sub-venue/space columns are now prefixed with `subvenue_` for clarity.
- Added RLS policy: venue owners can manage their own subvenues.
- All sub-venue/space management will use the `subvenues` table going forward.
- See `sql_commands.md` for full SQL and details. 

## [2024-08-02] Subvenues/Spaces Table Created
- Created `subvenues` table for all sub-venue/space data.
- Linked to main venue by `venue_id` (FK).
- Fields: subvenue_name, subvenue_description, subvenue_features, subvenue_images, subvenue_videos, subvenue_amenities, subvenue_capacity, subvenue_type, subvenue_status, created_at, updated_at.
- Added RLS policy: venue owners can manage their own subvenues.
- See `sql_commands.md` for full SQL and details. 

## [2024-08-03] Switched /venues route to new BrowseVenues component
- Replaced the old VenueList component with the new BrowseVenues component for the /venues route in App.tsx.
- This enables the new UI and features for browsing venues as planned.
- Old VenueList is no longer shown at /venues. 

## [2024-08-03] Connected BrowseVenues to Supabase
- Added data fetching to BrowseVenues page using venueService.getAllVenues().

**File Modified:** `src/pages/BrowseVenues.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Optimized image container for maximum fill:**
   - **Before:** `<img className="w-full h-48 object-cover" />`
   - **After:** 
     ```jsx
     <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden" style={{ position: 'relative', minHeight: '200px' }}>
       <img
         className="w-full h-full object-cover"
         style={{ objectPosition: 'center' }}
       />
     </div>
     ```

2. **Enhanced card layout for maximum image space:**
   - Added `h-full flex flex-col` to main card container for consistent height
   - Added `flex-shrink-0 flex-grow` to image container to maximize image space
   - Added `flex-shrink-0` to content section to minimize text space
   - Added `items-stretch` to grid for equal height cards
   - Reduced content padding and spacing for more image space

3. **Key improvements:**
   - Used `h-full` on image container to fill available space completely
   - Added `minHeight: '200px'` to ensure minimum image height
   - Used `w-full h-full object-cover` on image for complete container filling
   - Added `objectPosition: 'center'` for better image centering
   - Optimized content spacing to maximize image display area
   - Ensured images fill entire container without empty space

### Technical Details
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (standard landscape format)
- **Responsive:** Works on all screen sizes
- **Image Scaling:** `object-cover` ensures images fill container without distortion
- **Overflow Handling:** `overflow-hidden` prevents image spillover
- **Centering:** `objectPosition: 'center'` keeps image centered when cropped

### Verification
- ✅ Images now maintain 16:9 aspect ratio consistently
- ✅ Images fill entire container without empty borders
- ✅ Responsive across all screen sizes
- ✅ Clean, professional appearance similar to OYO cards
- ✅ No stretching or letterboxing issues

### Related Files Already Using Correct Implementation

### Impact

  if (images.length === 0) return [];
  if (images.length >= imagesToShow) return images;
  
  // Duplicate images to fill the display
  const repetitions = Math.ceil(imagesToShow / images.length) + 1;
  return Array.from({ length: repetitions }, () => images).flat();
};
```

##### Simplified Navigation:
