## 2025-01-08 02:30:00 - Super Admin Venue Approval/Rejection System Fix ✅

### **Problem Identified**
The super admin control panel venue approval and rejection options were not working properly due to:
1. **Incorrect database calls**: Using direct table updates instead of proper database functions
2. **Missing rejection reason input**: No modal for entering rejection reasons
3. **Incomplete error handling**: Not handling database function responses properly

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- The VenuesPage was calling `supabase.from('venues').update()` directly
- Should have been using the database functions `approve_venue()` and `reject_venue()`
- These functions handle proper updates, user role changes, and audit logging
- Rejection flow was missing a reason input modal

### **Solution Implemented**

#### **1. Fixed Database Calls (src/components/dashboard/VenuesPage.tsx)**
- **Replaced direct table updates** with proper RPC calls to database functions
- **Added proper error handling** for database function responses
- **Enhanced logging** for successful operations and errors
- **Maintained data refresh** after operations complete

- **Professional modal interface** for entering rejection reasons
- **Required field validation** to ensure reason is provided
- **User-friendly design** with clear instructions and warnings
- **Proper state management** for submission and cancellation

#### **3. Enhanced User Experience**
- **Approval flow**: Direct approval with automatic user role promotion
- **Rejection flow**: Modal prompts for rejection reason with validation
- **Error feedback**: Console logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Success feedback**: Console logging for successful operations

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Database Functions**: Using `approve_venue()` and `reject_venue()` RPC calls
- **State Management**: Added rejection modal state and venue tracking
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks with proper error logging
- **User Interface**: Professional modal with form validation

### **Database Functions Used**
1. **`approve_venue(venue_uuid, admin_notes)`**:
   - Updates venue status to approved
   - Promotes user to owner role
   - Logs approval in audit table
   - Sets approval date and admin

2. **`reject_venue(venue_uuid, rejection_reason, admin_notes)`**:
   - Updates venue status to rejected
   - Stores rejection reason
   - Logs rejection in audit table
   - Sets rejection date and admin

### **Files Modified**
- `src/components/dashboard/VenuesPage.tsx` - Fixed database calls and added rejection modal integration
- `src/components/dashboard/RejectionModal.tsx` - New component for rejection reason input

### **Impact**
- **Functionality**: Venue approval and rejection now work correctly
- **User Experience**: Professional rejection flow with reason input

- The issue was caused by data structure mismatches between BrowseVenues component and venueService
- Different components were expecting different field names (venue_name vs name, venue_type vs type)

**Solution Implemented:**

### 1. Fixed Venue Service Data Filtering
- **src/lib/venueService.ts**: Updated `getVenueById` function
  - Added approval status filtering: `.or('approval_status.eq.approved,is_approved.eq.true')`
  - This ensures only approved venues are returned, matching the BrowseVenues filter
  - Added data structure compatibility with field mapping for both naming conventions

### 2. Enhanced Data Structure Compatibility
- **src/lib/venueService.ts**: Updated venue data mapping in `getVenueById`
  - Added `venue_name: data.name || data.venue_name || ''`
  - Added `venue_type: data.type || data.venue_type || ''`
  - Added `price_per_hour: data.price_per_hour || data.hourly_rate || 0`
  - Added `price_per_day: data.price_per_day || data.daily_rate || 0`
  - Added `avg_rating: data.avg_rating || data.rating || 0`
  - Added `rating_count: data.rating_count || data.review_count || 0`
  - Added `photos: data.photos || data.images || []`
  - Added `image_urls: data.image_urls || data.images || []`

### 3. Updated Component Interfaces
- **src/pages/VenueDetail.tsx**: Created ExtendedVenue interface
  - Added support for both data structures (venue_name/name, venue_type/type)
  - Updated component to handle missing fields with fallbacks
  - Fixed image fallback logic to check multiple image fields
  - Updated VenueDescription, VenueReviews, and VenueBooking component calls

- **src/pages/VenueBooking.tsx**: Created ExtendedVenue interface

  - Changed from Venue to ExtendedVenue interface
  - Added fallback logic for venue name: `venue.venue_name || venue.name || 'Venue'`
  - Added fallback for description: `venue.description || 'No description available.'`

### 4. Removed Debug Code
- Removed temporary database test page and route
- Cleaned up console.log statements from components
- Removed debugging code that was added for troubleshooting

**Technical Details:**
- The issue was that BrowseVenues was filtering for approved venues, but getVenueById wasn't
- Different components expected different field names for the same data
- Added comprehensive fallback logic to handle both naming conventions
- Ensured all venue-related components work with the extended data structure

**Files Modified:**

## 2024-07-01  - Fix: Single-Tab Overlay Logic

**Changes Made:**
- Added cleanup for ACTIVE_TAB_KEY and ACTIVE_TAB_TIMESTAMP_KEY on tab close/unload in AuthContext.tsx.
- Implemented a timeout check for ACTIVE_TAB_TIMESTAMP_KEY (10s heartbeat) to prevent stale overlays when only one tab is open.
- Overlay now only appears if another tab is truly active for the same user session/role.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

**Technical Details:**
- On tab close/unload, if this tab is the active one, the active tab keys are removed from localStorage.
- On mount/focus/visibility, if the active tab timestamp is stale, the current tab claims active status.
- Prevents the "Switching Tabs..." overlay from showing when only one tab is open.

## [2024-08-02] Frontend Update: Merge 'owner' and 'super_admin' Roles
- Removed all references to 'owner' in frontend role checks and replaced with 'super_admin'.
- Updated comments and UI logic to clarify 'super_admin' is now the website owner.
- Documented all changes in code change log. 

## [2024-08-01] Session Persistence and Expiry Fixes

- Ensured Supabase client is initialized with persistSession: true and autoRefreshToken: true for all user roles in src/lib/supabase.ts.
- Updated periodic session validity check in AuthContext to add a grace period retry and avoid unnecessary sign-outs or redirects if already on the sign-in page.
- Updated all signOut and forced logout logic in AuthContext, Header, DashboardHeader, and ResetPassword to avoid redundant redirects or sign-outs if already on the sign-in page.
- Added comments to supabase.ts for future maintainers.
- These changes resolve issues where user and super admin sessions were expiring prematurely or being logged out unnecessarily after inactivity.

Context: See conversation summary and project rules for details. All changes tested and verified. 

## [2024-08-02] All Approved/Rejected Venues Set to Cricket (Sports Venue)

- Updated all venues with approval_status 'approved' or 'rejected' to have venue_type = 'Sports Venue' (closest enum for cricket venues).
- SQL command executed:
  ```sql
  UPDATE public.venues
  SET venue_type = 'Sports Venue'
  WHERE approval_status IN ('approved', 'rejected');
  ```
- Context: This ensures all previously approved or rejected venues are now classified as cricket venues for the new dashboard integration.
- See also: database/sql_commands.md for full details.
- Timestamp: 2024-08-02 

## [2024-06-08] Updated Venue Dashboard Navigation and Redirects
- All navigation links previously pointing to `/cricket-dashboard` now point to `/manageyourpage-dashboard` for uniqueness and consistency.
- Added redirect routes in `App.tsx` so that `/cricket-dashboard` and `/cricket-dashboard/*` automatically forward to `/manageyourpage-dashboard`.
- This prevents 404 errors for users with old links and ensures all navigation is routed to the correct dashboard. 

## [2024-06-08] Removed Demo Data from Manage Venue Dashboard Settings
- All demo/default values in the settings fields (profile, venue, notifications, business) have been cleared.
- Initial values are now empty or false, with no prefilled fake data.
- This ensures a clean state for new users and prevents confusion. 

## [2024-06-08] Fixed Vertical Line Overlapping Footer
- Removed `border-r` class from the AppSidebar component in `src/components/cricket-dashboard/AppSidebar.tsx`.
- The right border on the sidebar was extending the full height and visually overlapping with the footer.
- This ensures the sidebar border does not extend beyond the dashboard content area. 

## [2024-06-08] Fixed Welcome Section Background and Text Colors
- Changed welcome section background from `bg-primary` to `bg-green-600` for explicit green background.
- Updated text colors to `text-white` and `text-white/90` to ensure proper white text contrast against the green background.
- This ensures the welcome message is clearly visible with white text on green background as requested. 

## [2024-08-02] Subvenues/Spaces Schema Standardization
- Dropped legacy `sub_venues` table and all dependencies (CASCADE).
- Created canonical `subvenues` table for all sub-venue/space data.
- All sub-venue/space columns are now prefixed with `subvenue_` for clarity.
- Added RLS policy: venue owners can manage their own subvenues.
- All sub-venue/space management will use the `subvenues` table going forward.
- See `sql_commands.md` for full SQL and details. 

## [2024-08-02] Subvenues/Spaces Table Created
- Created `subvenues` table for all sub-venue/space data.
- Linked to main venue by `venue_id` (FK).
- Fields: subvenue_name, subvenue_description, subvenue_features, subvenue_images, subvenue_videos, subvenue_amenities, subvenue_capacity, subvenue_type, subvenue_status, created_at, updated_at.
- Added RLS policy: venue owners can manage their own subvenues.
- See `sql_commands.md` for full SQL and details. 

## [2024-08-03] Switched /venues route to new BrowseVenues component
- Replaced the old VenueList component with the new BrowseVenues component for the /venues route in App.tsx.
- This enables the new UI and features for browsing venues as planned.
- Old VenueList is no longer shown at /venues. 

## [2024-08-03] Connected BrowseVenues to Supabase
- Added data fetching to BrowseVenues page using venueService.getAllVenues().
- Mapped Supabase venue fields to the BrowseVenues UI interface.
- Venues are now displayed on the public browse page with loading and error handling. 

## [2024-08-03] Filtered BrowseVenues to show only approved venues with owner_id
- Updated venueService.getAllVenues to fetch only venues where approval_status = 'approved' or is_approved = true, and owner_id is not null.
- This ensures only valid, approved, and owned venues are shown on the public browse page.

## 2024-12-19 - Image Aspect Ratio Fix for Venue Cards

### Issue
- Venue cards in BrowseVenues page had images that were not maintaining proper 16:9 aspect ratio
- Images were using fixed height (`h-48`) instead of responsive aspect ratio
- Images appeared cropped, stretched, or letterboxed depending on container size
- Thumbnails did not stretch to full height inside their slots

### Solution
**File Modified:** `src/pages/BrowseVenues.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Optimized image container for maximum fill:**
   - **Before:** `<img className="w-full h-48 object-cover" />`
   - **After:** 
     ```jsx
     <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden" style={{ position: 'relative', minHeight: '200px' }}>
       <img
         className="w-full h-full object-cover"
         style={{ objectPosition: 'center' }}
       />
     </div>
     ```

2. **Enhanced card layout for maximum image space:**
   - Added `h-full flex flex-col` to main card container for consistent height
   - Added `flex-shrink-0 flex-grow` to image container to maximize image space
   - Added `flex-shrink-0` to content section to minimize text space
   - Added `items-stretch` to grid for equal height cards
   - Reduced content padding and spacing for more image space

3. **Key improvements:**
   - Used `h-full` on image container to fill available space completely
   - Added `minHeight: '200px'` to ensure minimum image height
   - Used `w-full h-full object-cover` on image for complete container filling
   - Added `objectPosition: 'center'` for better image centering
   - Optimized content spacing to maximize image display area
   - Ensured images fill entire container without empty space

### Technical Details
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9 (standard landscape format)
- **Responsive:** Works on all screen sizes
- **Image Scaling:** `object-cover` ensures images fill container without distortion
- **Overflow Handling:** `overflow-hidden` prevents image spillover
- **Centering:** `objectPosition: 'center'` keeps image centered when cropped

### Verification
- ✅ Images now maintain 16:9 aspect ratio consistently
- ✅ Images fill entire container without empty borders
- ✅ Responsive across all screen sizes
- ✅ Clean, professional appearance similar to OYO cards
- ✅ No stretching or letterboxing issues

### Related Files Already Using Correct Implementation

- `src/components/cricket-dashboard/BoxCard.tsx` - Cricket dashboard cards (already using `aspect-video`)
- `src/components/dashboard/VenueDetailsModal.tsx` - Admin modal (already using `aspectRatio: '16/9'`)

### Impact
