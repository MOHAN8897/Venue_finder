## 🧪 Testing the Payment Flow

### 1. **Quick Test on Home Page**
1. Navigate to the home page: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Scroll to the bottom - you'll see "Payment Integration Test" section
3. **Sign in first** (required for testing)
4. Click "Test Payment (₹100)" button
5. **Expected Result**: Razorpay modal should open with ₹100 test payment

### 2. **Full Booking Flow Test**
1. Go to any venue detail page
2. Select booking type (daily/hourly)
3. Choose dates/slots
4. Set guest count
5. Click "Book Now"
6. **Verify Payment Page Shows**:
   - ✅ Correct venue name
   - ✅ Selected dates (multiple for daily)
   - ✅ Time slots (for hourly)
   - ✅ Booking type
   - ✅ Guest count
   - ✅ Special requests
   - ✅ Proper pricing breakdown
7. Click "Pay Securely" 
8. **Expected**: Razorpay payment modal opens with UPI and other payment options

## 💰 UPI Payments in Test Mode

### ✅ UPI is Now Enabled
**Configuration Applied:**
```javascript
config: {
  display: {
    preferences: {
      show_default_blocks: true // Shows all payment methods including UPI
    }
  }
}
```

### 🧪 Testing UPI in Test Mode
**Test UPI IDs for Razorpay:**
- **Success**: `success@razorpay` (Use this to test successful UPI payments)
- **Failure**: `failure@razorpay` (Use this to test failed UPI payments)

**How to Test UPI:**
1. Complete booking flow and reach payment page
2. Click "Pay Securely"
3. In Razorpay modal, select **UPI** payment method
4. Enter test UPI ID: `success@razorpay`
5. Complete the test payment flow

**Note**: In test mode, UPI cancellation might show as successful. Use live mode for testing UPI cancellation scenarios.

## 📊 Database Booking Verification

### ✅ Checking if Bookings are Saved

**1. Check Bookings Table:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings 
WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

**2. Check Payments Table:**
```sql
SELECT b.id as booking_id, b.venue_id, b.event_date, b.booking_status,
       p.razorpay_payment_id, p.payment_status, p.total_amount
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN payments p ON b.id = p.booking_id
WHERE b.user_id = 'your_user_id'
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;
```

**3. Check Venue Slots (for hourly bookings):**
```sql
SELECT vs.*, b.id as booking_id
FROM venue_slots vs
LEFT JOIN booking_slots bs ON vs.id = bs.slot_id
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON bs.booking_id = b.id
WHERE vs.venue_id = 'venue_id' AND vs.date = 'booking_date';
```

### 🔍 Expected Database Records After Successful Payment

**Bookings Table:**
- ✅ New record with booking details
- ✅ `booking_status` = 'confirmed'
- ✅ `payment_status` = 'paid'
- ✅ Correct venue_id, user_id, dates, times

**Payments Table:**
- ✅ New payment record linked to booking
- ✅ `razorpay_payment_id` populated
- ✅ `payment_status` = 'paid'
- ✅ Correct amounts (venue_amount + platform_fee = total_amount)

**Venue Slots (Hourly Bookings):**
- ✅ Selected slots marked as `booked_by` = user_id
- ✅ Slot `available` = false

## 🔧 Latest Code Changes

### Enhanced Booking Data Validation
```javascript
// Fixed data conversion for database save
const bookingData = {
  venueId: booking.venueId,
  userId: booking.userId,
  eventDate: booking.eventDate,
  startTime: booking.startTime || '00:00:00',
  endTime: booking.endTime || '23:59:59',
  guestCount: parseInt(booking.guestCount || '1'), // Convert to number
  specialRequests: booking.specialRequests || '',
  venueAmount: parseInt(booking.venueAmount || '0'), // Convert from string paise to number
  bookingType: booking.bookingType as 'hourly' | 'daily',
  slot_ids: booking.slot_ids || []
};
```

### UPI Payment Method Enabled
```javascript
// Razorpay configuration with UPI enabled
config: {
  display: {
    preferences: {
      show_default_blocks: true // Shows UPI, Cards, NetBanking, Wallets
    }
  }
}
```

### Receipt ID Length Validation
```javascript
// Ensures receipt ID is under 40 characters
const generateReceiptId = () => {
  if (bookingId) {
    const id = `booking_${bookingId}`;
    return id.length <= 40 ? id : `bkg_${bookingId}`;
  } else {
    const timestamp = Date.now();
    const userShort = user.id.slice(-8);
    return `temp_${timestamp}_${userShort}`; // Under 40 chars
  }
};
```

3. Verify all records are created correctly
4. Check user dashboard shows the booking

## 🚨 Debugging Database Issues

### Check Database Functions
```sql
-- Verify booking creation function exists
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'create_booking_with_payment';

-- Check if function executes properly
SELECT create_booking_with_payment(
  'user_id', 'venue_id', '2025-01-24', 
  '10:00:00', '12:00:00', 2, 
  'test booking', 5000, 3500, 8500, 
  null, 'hourly', ARRAY['slot_id_1']
);
```

### Common Database Error Solutions
- **"Function does not exist"**: Run database migrations
- **"Permission denied"**: Check RLS policies
